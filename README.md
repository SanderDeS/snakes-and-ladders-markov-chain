# snakes-and-ladders-markov-chain
This is a python implementation of the game 'snakes and ladders'.  The goal of this program is not to actually play the game, but more for a the statistic properties of the game.

There are are two methods used for this analysis. First, there is the roll simulation, which is trying to simulate the classical rolling of the dice.
Second, we have the markov chains. This method used the transformation matrix, which is also constructed in the code.
